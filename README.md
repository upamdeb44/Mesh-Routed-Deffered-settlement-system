# Mesh-Routed Deferred Settlement System

> Built as a portfolio project to explore distributed systems, cryptographic security, and fault-tolerant payment architecture.

Java 21 · Spring Boot · RSA · AES-GCM · Maven

A proof-of-concept backend system that simulates offline UPI-style payments over a software-simulated Bluetooth mesh network - no internet required on the sender's end.

Payments are encrypted on the sender's device, broadcast to nearby phones, and hop device-to-device through untrusted intermediaries until a bridge node with connectivity uploads the packet to the backend for settlement. The backend then decrypts, deduplicates, and settles the transaction exactly once.

**How it works:**
- Sender encrypts a payment packet using hybrid RSA + AES-GCM encryption
- Packet hops through simulated mesh nodes, with TTL decremented on each hop to prevent stale or looping packets
- Bridge node (simulated internet-connected device) uploads the packet to the Spring Boot backend
- Backend hashes the ciphertext, checks an idempotency cache via atomic compare-and-set to prevent duplicate settlement
- Tampered or expired packets are rejected before touching the ledger
- Valid packets are handed off to `SettlementService` for credit/debit processing

**This project simulates:**
- 5 mesh participants (sender, intermediaries, bridge node, receiver)
- Full packet lifecycle from encryption to settlement
- Concurrent duplicate packet arrival from multiple bridge nodes

**Known limitations of the concept:**
- Receiver cannot verify sender funds offline — double-spend risk exists
- Real Bluetooth mesh is constrained by Android 8.0+ and iOS peripheral mode restrictions
- Carrying encrypted packets on stranger devices raises metadata privacy concerns

## The demo flow (step by step)

The dashboard has four buttons that walk through the full pipeline. The intended sequence:

### Step 1 — Compose a payment

Choose sender, receiver, amount, PIN. Click **"📤 Inject into Mesh"**.

**What actually happens on the backend:**
- The server pretends to be the sender's phone.
- It builds a `PaymentInstruction` with a unique nonce and current timestamp.
- It encrypts that with the server's RSA public key (using hybrid encryption — see below).
- It wraps the ciphertext in a `MeshPacket` with a TTL of 5.
- It hands the packet to `phone-jake`, an offline virtual device.

You'll see `phone-bridge` now holds 1 packet.

### Step 2 — Run gossip rounds

Click **"🔄 Run Gossip Round"**. Then click it again.

Each round, every device that holds a packet broadcasts it to every other device within "Bluetooth range" (which, in our simulator, means everyone). TTL decrements per hop.

After 1 round: every device holds the packet. After 2 rounds: still every device — TTL is just lower.

In the real system this would happen organically as people walk past each other in the basement.

### Step 3 — Bridge node walks outside

Click **"📡 Bridges Upload to Backend"**.

`phone-bridge` is the only device with `hasInternet=true`. The dashboard simulates that phone walking outside and getting 4G. It POSTs every packet it holds to `/api/bridge/ingest`.

The backend pipeline runs:
1. Hash the ciphertext (`SHA-256`).
2. Try to claim the hash in the idempotency cache.
3. If claimed: decrypt with the server's RSA private key.
4. Verify freshness (signedAt within 24 hours).
5. Run the debit/credit in a single DB transaction.

Watch the **Account Balances** table — money has moved. Watch the **Transaction Ledger** — a new row appears.

### Step 4 — Demonstrate idempotency (the killer feature)

Reset the mesh. Inject a single packet. Run gossip 2 times. Now **all 5 devices hold the same packet, including multiple bridges in a more complex setup**.

To really see idempotency in action, modify `MeshSimulatorService.java` to seed multiple bridge devices, or just:

1. Click "Inject" once.
2. Click "Gossip" twice.
3. Click "Flush Bridges" — only `phone-bridge` is a bridge in the default seed, so just one upload happens.

To exercise the *concurrent duplicate* case properly, run the test:
```cmd
mvnw.cmd test -Dtest=IdempotencyConcurrencyTest#singlePacketDeliveredByThreeBridgesSettlesExactlyOnce
```

This test creates one packet, fires 3 threads at `BridgeIngestionService.ingest()` simultaneously, and verifies that exactly one settles, two are dropped as duplicates, and the sender is debited exactly once.
